Anyone who has worked in software development has seen when IT systems are built for a business where the data is needed to be referenced again in future, it is stored in Databases. The remaining application is built around the data store either reading it or writing into this database. The Data access modules, Business logic and various other abstractions like APIs or Events or messages are all built on top of the data stored in the database.

You can think of Bitcoin Ledger in a similar manner. It is a database that is structured in a special form where records are made up of transactions grouped in a segment called a block and these blocks are updated every 10 mins with a new block of data. It could be implemented using any of the databases but to give example, in the current implementation of protocol, internally the storage of blocks uses LevelDB database and the data is stored in raw format (as binary in blk000n.dat files).
