What is Bitcoin Ledger analogous to when it comes to comparison to the existing Software applications?
It is analogous to the CPU which processes the data and code.
It is analogous to the databases which store the persisted data for an application.
It is analogous to the RAM which temporarily stores (remembers) everything currently running on a device.
None of the above. 2.

What is unique about the bitcoin privacy model?
Privacy is achieved when Identity is decoupled from transactions allowing privacy but not anonymity.
Privacy is achieved when Identity is decoupled from transactions allowing privacy and anonymity.
Privacy is achieved thru the decentralisation of nodes across the network.
Privacy is achieved by ECDSA (Elliptic curve digital signing algorithm). 3.

What kind of infrastructure can be built to use bitcoin as a data store for Business applications?
Building APIs which access data present on the blockchain/ledger.
Building Event listeners for listening to specific data/identifiers in the bitcoin transactions.
Building temporary databases which updates data from bitcoin in real time.
All of the above. 4.

Can you build state machines on Bitcoin? (one correct selection necessary to proceed)
No, it is not possible to build state machines on Bitcoin.
Yes, it is possible to build state machines (Finite state machines and Infinite state machines) on bitcoin where transactions act as the events changing the state of the machine from previous state to the next state.
Yes, it is possible to build Finite state machines but not the Infinite state machines on bitcoin.
Yes, it is possible to build deterministic and non-deterministic finite state machines using Bitcoin Script. 5.

Bitcoin Ledger satisfies the ACID properties of a Database. This statement is?
True
False
