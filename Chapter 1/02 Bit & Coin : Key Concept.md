Coin

The maximum number of bitcoins that can ever be created is 21 million. Currently about 18,500,000 bitcoins are already mined and are in circulation. As per the mining schedule, by the year 2140 all of the possible bitcoins will be mined and from then nodes will purely have to depend on transaction fees for their rewards.

An electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures and an owner transfers the coin to the new owner by a transaction. A transaction consists of an input record (owner digitally signing the hash of the previous transaction) and the public key for the next owner (recipient).

This diagram above shows how a transaction is in terms of its components and ownership of the coins that a transaction is made to transfer. Payee or recipient of a transaction can always verify the validity of the transaction by using his private key to validate the transfer of ownership via this transaction as shown above. These transactions are batched together in a Timestamp server which takes the Hash of the batch of transactions and then widely publishes the hash as shown in the Graphic. This timestamp proves that the transactions must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get included into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

Money is integrated in this system in the form of something called UTXO. This is quite different from the traditional model of money storage in electronic form which typically uses the idea of an account and then the transfer of money from one account to another account. In this case, both accounts being held by one or more trusted third party (banks for ex.) on behalf of the original owner of those funds.

UTXO is an acronym for Unspent Transaction Output, which literally means that they are the unspent coins that are present in an output created by a transaction. When the Bitcoin network was launched, the complete supply of coins, that is 21 million, was created but were not distributed in the network. The distribution of these coins happens with the Proof-of-Work process discussed earlier.

The typical distribution involves a minting or “Coinbase” transaction, which is created by the node adding the block as the first transaction in the block. This transaction will assign the node itself a set of coins defined by distribution rules of the network, which currently is 6.25 bitcoins per block reward. This transaction will have input as “Coinbase” and output will be 6.25 bitcoins locking them to node’s Public key. Likewise, all of the coins that exist in the network are first created by a Coinbase transaction and then on transferred from one owner to another and at any point in time exists as a set of coins which are present in millions of these transaction outputs. Hence the acronym, UTXO.

All UTXOs at a given time can be collected into a set, called the UTXO set and this set represents the current state of ownership of all Bitcoin in existence at any point in time. The inputs of transactions that are proposed for addition to ledger are checked against this set. If an input to a transaction is an output in the UTXO set, the input can be validated. The UTXO set is deterministic for every Bitcoin block, that is, every node who has validated the history of the Bitcoin ledger up to a particular block should have an identical UTXO set. This is required in order for nodes to reach consensus on the validity of inputs in new transactions. This innovation provides for getting rid of the complete idea of static accounts which are commonly used in current financial systems.

UTXO themselves are not the coins but are analogous to envelopes which store the real electronic unit or tokens of value in this system, called a Satoshi. One Satoshi is always = One Satoshi. A UTXO typically right now is looked into terms of a Bitcoin where 1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 Satoshi. The 1 Bitcoin or 1 BSV here is an envelope which stores 10 raised to 8 Satoshi tokens. So at any point of time the bitcoin network contains N number of “coins” or “bitcoins” which are UTXO envelopes of the Satoshi tokens held in locking scripts that typically use ECDSA cryptography.

The Cryptography involves the Private and Public Key pairs where the public key is really a value derived by Private key ergo the coins are locked using the private key. A transfer of coin means the owner of one envelope electronically transfers full or part of the tokens present in the envelope to the intended owners by locking these coins to their public key. These coins can only be unlocked by the intended owner’s private key. These transactions always will need a small number of tokens to be paid to the non-trusted third party, the network of nodes who maintain the ledger and the transactions validity and integrity. All existing UTXOs at any point in time are accounted for and maintained in the blockchain which is analogous to an accounting ledger containing both the credit and debit entries.

One last thing to elaborate about Bitcoin is the misnomer that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. The word crypto comes from cryptic and currency means a legal tender from a sovereign government of a country. Bitcoin writes all transactions on a global public ledger in cleartext and it's probably the best method to use if you want to add transparency, traceability and audit-ability into a system. It is exactly opposite of Crypto and as per many rulings by supreme courts of various countries like USA, India and others, it is deemed at best a commodity but not a legal tender, so it is definitely not a currency either. So the adjective, misnomer. Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency, but is it money? Yes, it could be if there is an inherent value that arises out of usage of the coins. It is a form of digital asset (Property with property rights) in the closest way of defining it legally.

Bit

Apart from just being the protocol which allows money or value exchange between two entities, Bitcoin also has provisions to add data to these transactions. This enables users to add various kinds of information to a transaction like a text message, an image file, application code, or metadata. In fact, this is such a huge part of Bitcoin that this course will have many chapters dedicated to talking about how to append a blob of data along with the transactions and use Bitcoin as a data storage entity.

Bitcoin from the start was designed to support various sizes of data bytes in a transaction which goes up to about 4 gb per transaction but due to historical reasons most of this capability was restricted in many years of operations of the network. Bitcoin transactions input and output contains a script which has designated codes to append data. In the last couple of years these restrictions are gradually being removed in addition to creation of node software which can support such data while processing transactions.

Just one small change of supporting data via a script code known as OP_RETURN created an explosion of protocol development using the 100 KB data allowed with the transaction by the network of nodes earlier in 2018. Since then things have been changing with much more data inclusion possible with some other script codes known as OP_PUSHDATAx.

This is the Bit part of the Bitcoin network. Bit meaning information, is possible to be stored in the Bitcoin ledger in a manner that makes it something similar to a notarised entry. Once the data/information or Bit is updated on the ledger it becomes a timestamped entry of that data which in future will be available globally and in a public manner. One basic example of usage of something like this is an existence of a contract between two parties, which they can create and store as is with themselves as they do now, but in addition to that, they hash (SHA256 or other) the digital format of the contract and store that hash in a transaction (which will need a cost of less than 1/100 of a cent).

Later on, if one of the parties tried to manipulate even a single character written in that contract, it will generate a completely new hash making it impossible for either of them to tamper with. And this record will be available at all times till the Bitcoin network exists, which means for an infinite possible timeframe from now. Such property of the usage of network allows for a plethora of utility of using this network for storing not just contracts, but also application database, legal documents, billing and invoicing and for that matter something as simple as weather data for immutable history archiving.

Hashing of data plays an important function in this to act as checksum and ensure immutability for the underlying data, but still keeping the work to be done to do the verification quite trivial. This is demonstrated by a small example - by hashing a text explaining what is hash and then by changing a single character which is the first letter 'A' but keeping everything the same and displaying the two SHA256 hash values.
