Coin

The maximum number of bitcoins that can ever be created is 21 million. Currently about 18,500,000 bitcoins are already mined and are in circulation. As per the mining schedule, by the year 2140 all of the possible bitcoins will be mined and from then nodes will purely have to depend on transaction fees for their rewards.

An electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures and an owner transfers the coin to the new owner by a transaction. A transaction consists of an input record (owner digitally signing the hash of the previous transaction) and the public key for the next owner (recipient).
