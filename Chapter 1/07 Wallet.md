Typically, the creation of a Bitcoin transaction and storing of Satoshi tokens/bitcoins are performed by a software for key management called a wallet. Additionally, a wallet can provide functions related to creating and sending transactions, sending messages with the encryption using the same keys which are locking the coins and many more depending on how advanced the wallet software is.

There are different types of wallets as well some even storing the keys on the behalf of users becoming custodial wallets. Most of the exchanges (cryptocurrency) perform this role of being custodian of their users and are custodial wallets. Others which provide a Software for users to install and use are non-custodial wallets like the electrumsv and HandCash wallets. There are also wallets like the Moneybutton wallets which donâ€™t need a software and are web-based products but still require users to own and store the keys (or the seed phrase used to generate the keys) and continue to stay non-custodial wallets.

There is also an important concept of SPV. In short, an SPV is a lightweight client which only stores the block headers and merkle roots which are the only things needed for verification of a transaction being valid or not. More details about the SPV client are provided in the wiki: https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/Simplified_Payment_Verification.

SPV is most useful for proving a payment happened. Especially when small value payments are confirmed instantly (zero-confirmation) this happens due to a SPV check or SPV proof that ensures the merchant taking the payment that this is not a double spend and it is a valid payment to accept even though it is either yet to be mined or processed in a block by the mining network. For large value payments it is still advisable to wait for few block confirmations so as there is no possibility of the transaction being lost in orphan blocks. We will discuss SPV in more detail when we talk about Payment protocols in a later chapter.

Wallet clients typically provide not just key management but also transaction management capabilities. They will abstract most of the low-level functionality of building a transaction using the user keys and allow for a similar user experience that any payment wallet does. Once the transaction is created, the next step to this will be for the user to broadcast this transaction to the bitcoin network.

This is done either by the user directly broadcasting the transaction (if using a SPV wallet) or the wallet service provider broadcasting it on the behalf of user. Typically, the wallet service provider will have a few selected nodes which they will broadcast these transactions to and then it is the responsibility of the node to propagate the transaction to the rest of the node network. One important concept to note here is that the node network typically are hyper connected with each other so the overall propagation of transactions happens quite quickly (milli seconds or less).
